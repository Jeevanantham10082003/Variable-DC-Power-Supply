🔋 Variable DC Power Supply using LM2596

This project demonstrates a basic variable DC power supply built using an LM2596 buck converter module. The output voltage can be smoothly adjusted using a 10k potentiometer, and the output voltage and current are monitored in real time using a digital voltmeter/ammeter (DNS-VC288).
This project is intended for learning and small electronics testing.

✨ Features
Adjustable DC output voltage
Input supply: 12 V DC, 2 A
Output voltage range: ~1.25 V to 11.5 V
Real-time voltage and current display
Compact and simple hardware design
Beginner-friendly electronics project

🧰 Components Used
LM2596 DC-DC Buck Converter
12 V DC Adapter (2 A)
DNS-VC288 Digital Voltmeter/Ammeter
10k Potentiometer
Connecting wires

🔌 Working Principle
The LM2596 steps down the 12 V DC input to a lower adjustable DC voltage.
The 10k potentiometer controls the output voltage level.
The digital voltmeter/ammeter displays output voltage and current drawn by the load in real time.

🎯 Applications
Powering Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32
LED and sensor testing
Small DC motor testing
Educational lab experiments

⚠️ Limitations
No built-in fuse or protection circuit
Manual care required to avoid short circuits
Not recommended for high-power loads.
